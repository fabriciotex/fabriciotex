- 🪪 I’m Fabricio Teixeira from Brazil 🇧🇷, currently based in AZ 🇺🇸.
- 🧐 I’m interested in being a **Fullstack Dev**, so I'm improving my front-end skills and learning back-end like **Node.js** and **Spring Boot**.
- 💪 I’m currently reviewing **JS**, **React.js**, **React Native** and other front-end libraries.
- 🗄 Check some of my work [here](https://github.com/fabriciotex) and in my [codepen](https://codepen.io/fabriciotex).
- ⌨️ You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/fabriciotex).
